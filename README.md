# Admin dashboard

This is a mock-up of a dashboard, for use in
practicing both grid and flex in css.
As well as making a responsive web design.

It has:
1: A header that has a search bar, alert
icon(bell), users avatar, username, a greeting
for the username, and a few links.

2: A side nav bar with a title of where 'we' are 
(Dashboard), and links to various parts of the page.
With seperate parts for general, and settings/support.

3: A main part, with cards of various information.
Next to the main cards, is 'Announcements' and 'Trending'.
